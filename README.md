# Background 

As a sales manager, one of the most time consuming aspects of my job is to review sales calls. Over time, I have refined my coaching framework to be systematized and have I trained a ChatGPT agent to provide this kind of feedback. 

Sales Coach AI takes sales call transcripts -> feeds them into this custom GPT and gets expert coaching as if I was coaching. 

## Version 1

https://sales-ai-app-v-2-rohan75.replit.app/

This is a super simple html/css with an integrated Airtable form. 

From there, the response goes into Zapier which sends it into ChatGPT

## Version 2

I overhauled the UI to be built in react with a firebase backend. 

## Version 3 (current as of July 2024) 

I added the ability to login and when a user logs in, their previous submissions are stored.
